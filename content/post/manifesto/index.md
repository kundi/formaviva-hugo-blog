There probably hasn’t been a field in the industry as electronic music on internet that would have changed so much in the last years — not necessarily in the positive way. So much that the whole ecosystem, genre perception and old websites were twisted and turned upside down. With Beatport and Soundcloud commercializing music and encouraging average music content, and without vision of the future, the alternative electronic music artists seem to be left behind with using alternatives such Spotify as Bandcamp, which are not really suited to the needs of the time. And are sufficient in getting music distributed, but is that really what could there be?

We’ve been preparing for this moment as long as we can remember. The music world needs a change.

# Existing platforms overview

## Beatport

I remember the times when Beatport was the one main source where you would go to look for electronic music. I admired their old outstanding flash-technology website, which back in times was quite advanced, and made browsing and finding music an enjoyable experience that other websites could not get close to. It was a perfect combination with forward-thinking electronic music. Being on a platform like Beatport, it meant something. If you weren’t there, it was like you were non-existent in the music scene.
Soundcloud
Then there was Soundcloud. A great, promising platform, which brought a new and better listening experience in times when there was no other platform for that purpose. So it somehow made sense to pay hundred bucks to get more hosting space for tracks and mixes there when there were not other sites to do it.

But as years went by, times on internet have changed. The infrastructure became cheaper, and the owners of those websites started focusing on producing and selling more music. Beatport upgraded their website, but soon got left years behind development of the scene and the online culture that should have complemented it. On the other hand, Soundcloud never was able to bring any other innovation or improvement to their platform. They got stuck focusing on providing the same kind of service as in the beginning. But ability to just host music was not enough.

With acquisition of Beatport by SFX (the company that runs Tomorrowland and other commercial events), and inability of Soundcloud to adapt to the new consumer needs, they became a dumping point for poor musical content and commercial electronic music.
Spotify
On the other hand, giant platforms like Spotify or Apple music were never a good option for alternative artists because of their business models and calculations behind rewards for creators. They are designed to make main-stream popular artists rich, and dishonour alternative artists, which are paid on the same criteria as mainstream artists, which hardly makes them earn any pennies, even though they are actually ones who create quality content.


Bandcamp
Then there appeared to be some bright light in the end of the tunnel. Bandcamp. A promising platform with different mentality behind, supporting artists and labels and enabling them to merchandise their music and earn money they deserve. It put power in hands of the content creators, and allowed them to be in control of releasing music and selling it.

But, there was and is one problem. It is that Bandcamp was not made for electronic music. Nor was it made by people who understand what a good user experience on internet is and what it should be (in this case listening and finding new music). And there for its not a platform designed truly designed for electronic music.

Why? It doesn’t take a lot of effort to notice the reasons for that — 1 click player, painful checkout, dysfunctional music discovery algorithms, poor streaming options, and we could go on…

Bandcamp is great. But it’s not the ideal solution for electronic music. We believe there could and should be more.

### Other platforms

### With all those semi-working options, still djs  and music lovers today need to go to multiple places to find what they are looking for. From unfavourable Youtube, to Bandcamp and Soundcloud where one can listen mostly only to snippets, and to local dj vinyl and digital stores such as juno, deejay.de, ….

There is no single platform of authority, which would encourage alternative electronic music creators to create, share and support their music by providing them with a platform for good user experience, thriving community and fair fees.

This is the reason why we decided to develop Formaviva.

Formavision
With Formaviva we want to solve the problems mentioned above. Our first step is to bring good listening experience with easy merchandising for labels and artists, and seamless purchasing with a fast checkout process for the users.

We want to build a curated library of quality electronic music. We will let the community decide who and what kind of music they want to have on the platform, which should be fitting to certain quality and asthetic standards in the means of the underground / alternative electronic music. We want to build a platform and a community for true electronic music enthusiasts, and find best ways to make the ecosystem evolve and thrive as an underground electronic music community that is missing at the moment.

The platform vision is to enable both new and established artists to distribute and promote music, regardless of the number of likes and advertising efforts they put into the platform. If the music is good, and if certain “profiles” that have established authority in the community support the music, it should become more exposed. And that should be the only criteria - to expose and promote good music, and enable everyone to have equal opportunities and be rewarded for their work.

There are many electronic music producers who remain and keep unnoticed, because of lack of such community that would enable exposure of their music to the right people who are perceptive for it.

But we are aware that the path there is long, and that it will take time.

So we are starting at the beginning.

Here are the problems that we’re already solving:

1. High-quality waveform persistent player
   A player that feels good should be one of the most important components on the website. With a good representation of waveform and high-quality streaming.
2. Easy merchandising
   Ability to configure digital and physical music merchandising fast, and enable creators to get insights they need to adjust content to their listeners.
3. Fast checkout
   Giving listeners ability to be able to complete the checkout is the fastest possible way, without unnecessary steps.
4. Advanced analytics
   With the first version of the platform, we already have heatmap tracking on the music, so everyone can see how listeners interact with the music.
5. Curated music
   The only way to establish a healthy ecosystem and community is to limit and set standards for the high-quality content that we would all want. We want to enable music enthusiasts so they can influence who and what kind of music they want to have on the platform.
6. Wire-transfer / PayPal payment
   Allow content creators to decide when and how they want to get paid. We want to do best we can do to reduce their costs and barriers around receiving payments.

We are visionnaires. Here are some more things that we want to bring on the platform:

* Fast sync
  Automatic sync of all music that you purchase on the platform directly to your Desktop / Mobile.
* Music analysis
  More sophisticated and innovative ways of music analysis.
* Recommendations
  Improved recommendations systems adjusted for alternative electronic music.
* Music library management
  Ability to automatically sync purchased music with your local audio library with CDJ processed files and file naming adjusted to your preference.
* Mobile app
  Mobile app, designed for improved music discovery and listening experience.
* Cryptocurrency payment
  Ability to support artists and purchase products with cryptocurrencies.

A
The future is bright. We are excited.

We believe that this platform will make a difference -- to enable artists to reach the right and broader audience they deserve for their music.
